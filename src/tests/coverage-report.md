### Well-Covered Areas:
- Flashcard and Deck models have excellent coverage (>90%)
- API endpoints for flashcard generation are well tested
- Core utility functions have good coverage

### Areas Needing Improvement:
- Firebase integration could use more integration tests
- Error handling paths in some API functions need more tests
- Some edge cases in the authentication flow need coverage

### Next Steps:
1. Add integration tests for Firebase interactions
2. Improve error handling test coverage
3. Add more boundary tests for API rate limiting
4. Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows
